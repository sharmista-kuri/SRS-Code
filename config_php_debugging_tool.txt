FirePHP is a library that allows you not really debugging (no break points etc.) but also to trace and log messages that will be easily read in the Firebug console!

Here are the step by step procedure regarding how to incorporate FirePHP to CodeIgniter:
1.	To start, you first need to install the FirePHP extension from Mozilla’s Firefox Add-ons site. This requires that you already have Firebug installed in your browser.
2.	Download FirePHP core (Download link: https://github.com/firephp/firephp-core).
3.	Unzip the archive and rename the file /firephp-core-master/lib/fb.php to /firephp-core-master/lib/Firebug.php. Also rename the ‘class FB’ to ‘class Firebug’ of the file /firephp-core-master/lib/Firebug.php.
4.	Copy the file /firephp-core-master/lib/Firebug.php and /firephp-core-master/lib/FirePHP.class.php in your CodeIgniter based project’s directory /{Project_Name}/application/libraries.
5.	Then you only need to log some calls to get values displayed in the Firebug console, like:

$CI =& get_instance();
$CI->load->library('firebug'); 
$CI->firebug->log($data, "my data");

Inside Controller:
$CI =& get_instance();
$CI->load->library('firebug');  
$CI->firebug->log($data['vendor_list'], "my data");

Inside View:
$CI =& get_instance();
$CI->load->library('firebug');  // for using firebug 
$CI->firebug->log($vendor_list, "my data");

Other Examples:
$CI->firebug->log("message"); 
$CI->firebug->info($data, "my info ...");
$CI->firebug->warn($data, "my warning ");
$CI->firebug->error($data, "my error");
